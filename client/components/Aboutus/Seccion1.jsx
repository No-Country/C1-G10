        In 2019, we were already avid entrepreneurs. We are absolutely hooked on
        the IT world, generate applications and webs through codes, the ability
        to do what you like from anywhere of the world, interact with people
        from different countries and power carry out team projects. We felt that
        connection and we decided to make our own way, convinced that No Country
        is something that deserves to be shared with the world, since many of us
        travel the same road and what we want to achieve is that we travel it
        together and thus be able to achieve fulfill objectives, goals and
        dreams in a more professional way, where learning is a constant that
        will accompany us throughout the process and enthusiasm will grow more
        and more for the achievements that we will be complying. This is not a
        group, it is a community and any person is welcome, all were once
        juniors and juniors great things are born, that is why for us they are
        the priority and all together we will make NO COUNTRY grow.
